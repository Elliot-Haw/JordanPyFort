#Things I need the main application to do:
#Connect to an interface (locally hosted frontend web page - React)
#Have the main.py connect all of the different APIs together
#Have the main.py, concatenate all the information using AI, and train it to give recommended market moves
#Have an organised folder structure, with each API connecting into main
#Have a web scraping tool which will allow the gathering of information
#Make it give different information at different times, before market open, close etc
#Have it come through to my phone
